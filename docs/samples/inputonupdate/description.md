Hashspace manages a custom event handler on input and textarea elements: **onupdate**. It is fired after a certain duration after the content of the field has been changed, and the timer is restarted each time the content is changed.  
By default, the timer duration is 500ms. It can be changed by defining a **update-timeout** attribute.

The following examples show the custom event handler in action:
