<p>This example shows how to develop a simple pagination component based on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> CSS framework</p>
[#output]
<p>As you can see, supporting custom events in a component simply requires two lines of code:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the component <em>$attributes</em> section, the developer needs to declare the callback attribute - such as <em>onpageselect</em> in this example. Note that the event name should be lower case to follow the HTML conventions.</li>
<li>in the method where the event needs to be raised, you simply need to call the event callback and pass the event object properties as argument - c.f. <em>this.onpageselect({pageNumber:this.activepage})</em> in this example</li>
</ul>
